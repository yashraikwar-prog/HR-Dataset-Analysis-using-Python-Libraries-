# HR-Dataset-Analysis-using-Python-Libraries-
Overview
This project contains a Jupyter notebook (HR Dataset Project file.ipynb) that performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an HR dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and NumPy. The dataset (HRDatasets.csv) is analyzed to uncover insights about employee metrics, including hiring trends, department headcounts, positions, attrition, salary, age, and tenure.
